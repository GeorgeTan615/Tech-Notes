## Pub/Sub System
Pub/Sub system is a messaging pattern that allows publishers to send messages to topics in a messaging broker, and subscribers who are subscribed to the topics would all receive the published message to that topic without being aware of who are the publishers.

## Message Queue
Message queue is also a software where senders can send messages to certain queues where the messages will be pushed into the queue. Once the message is consumed by a single receiver, the message is popped off.
